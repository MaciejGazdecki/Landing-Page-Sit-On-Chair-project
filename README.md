# Landing-page-sit-on-chair-project
This is my first project, of the landing page, which I had to perform after the first module of intensive bootcamp of JavaScript Developer:React, which I study in CodersLab programming School. During the first module of fourty hours of classes and a lot of personal studying and home classes, I gain a extensive knowledge about HTML5 and CSS and a basic knowledge of JavaScript. Please be aware that <b>this page is not yet scaled for mobile devices</b> and for now <b>it can only be displayed properly only in FullHD 1920 * 1080 screen.</b> In the future I will follow this project and I will project brake-points for other resolutions using @media and other RWD tools.

I obtained the jpg file with the project (screenshot of the page) from my mentor, and the task consisted of reconstructing this page by coding it using HTML and CSS. I have to project entire html tree and then style all using CSS. I opted for using Flexbox, which I consider a very powerful tool. Sometimes I used other properties of CSS to align elements properly.

I added something extra from me to this project. I created a few simple animations using JavaScript and CSS like:<br>
    • animated arrow, which scroll the page to the top,<br>
    • a simple banner, which change two images,<br>
    • a simple drop-down menu,<br>
    • an effect when hovering the images of the second section;<br>
    • effects when hovering the price plans,<br>


I hope you like it :-)
